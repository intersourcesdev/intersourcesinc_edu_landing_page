                    <p class="white-text">
                        The Website uses “cookies” (whether of the Company or of third parties) to help you personalize
                        your
                        online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page
                        server.
                        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
                        purpose
                        of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if
                        you
                        register with the Company’s Website or services, a cookie helps Company to recall your specific
                        information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
                        information,
                        such as addresses, username and so on. When you return to the Website, the information you
                        previously
                        provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.
                        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
                        cookies,
                        but
                        you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to
                        decline
                        cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Company’s

                        Security of your Personal Information
                        Company reasonably secures the personally identifiable information you provide from unauthorized
                        access,
                        use, or disclosure on computer servers in a controlled and secured environment, protected from
                        unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, User acknowledges that the Website, the
                        Services
                        and
                        their information protection systems are not immune from any breaches or sabotage, and third
                        party

                        malicious files of any kind, viruses, worms, Trojan horses and the such. User agrees that the
                        Company
                        shall not be liable in any way for any damage whatsoever that may result of any such third party
                        behavior.
                        Changes to this Policy
